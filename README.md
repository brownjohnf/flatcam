FlatCAM: 2D Computer-Aided PCB Manufacturing
============================================

This repo was forked from https://bitbucket.org/jpcgt/flatcam. I added support
for building/running FlatCAM from a Docker container (Linux support only). This
has only been tested on Arch Linux, `4.10.8-1-ARCH`.

## Running in Docker

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `make run`. This will build the Docker image, and then run the container,
   mounting in the necessary sockets for X. It will also allow the root user
   inside the container to access your user's X session.

FlatCAM is a program for preparing CNC jobs for making PCBs on a CNC router.
Among other things, it can take a Gerber file generated by your favorite PCB
CAD program, and create G-Code for Isolation routing.
